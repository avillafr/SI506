SI 506 Programming Final Project: Alexis Villafranca

## Project Description:
My project requests data from the New York Times and the Guardian API's. My topic of interest to search on both platforms is 'Houston Astros', the Major League Baseball team. I have defined two functions to request the API data, defined two classes to further investigate the API data, and my code creates a csv file by utilizing the classes I defined.

## Files Submitted:
1. SI506F18_final_project.py
2. README.txt
3. SAMPLEarticles.csv

## Python Modules Imported:
1. import requests
2. import json
3. import csv

## Specific Directions:
A person should locate the directory of my file SI506F18_final_project.py after downloading it. They should run it using Python 3. They should type python3 SI506F18_final_project.py in the command prompt and hit enter.

## Result of Project Once It Runs:
Once the program runs, in the same directory you should find a CSV file called articles.csv, which should have five columns, containing information about the article title, section, website url, date of publication, and the number of characters in the title.

## Primary Technical Requirements by Line:
1. Cache all data: 5-25, 33-45, 57-69
2. Retrieve data from 2 different API endpoints: 28-32, 52-56
3. Include at least 2 function definitions: 28-33, 52-57
4. Include at least 2 class definitions: 76-115, 122-158
5. Create at least 1 instance of each class and invoke methods on them: 79 & 117, 125 & 160
6. Accumulate data: 165-170, 173-179
7. Write data to a file: 182-188
